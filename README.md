This program allows users to create an account, login, deposit, withdraw, transfer, and check their balance. It does not implement transaction history or recipient account updates. 

Note that this program uses a simple password storage mechanism, which is not secure. In a real-world application, you should use a secure password hashing and verification mechanism. 

 Bank Management System: 

Structures: 

The code defines two structures: struct account and struct transaction. 

struct account contains information about a bank account, including the username, password, and balance. 

struct transaction represents a transaction between accounts, including details like sender (from), recipient (to), and the transaction amount. 

Functions: 

createAccount(struct account *acc):  

This function creates a new account by accepting user input for the username and password. 

It initializes the account’s balance to zero. 

After creating the account, it calls the login function. 

login(struct account *acc):  

This function handles user login. 

It prompts the user to enter their username and password. 

If the provided credentials match the stored account information, the user is logged in. 

The user can then perform various banking operations (deposit, withdraw, transfer, etc.). 

deposit(struct account *acc):  

Allows the user to deposit money into their account. 

The deposited amount is added to the account’s balance. 

withdraw(struct account *acc):  

Enables the user to withdraw money from their account. 

The withdrawn amount is subtracted from the account’s balance. 

transfer(struct account *acc):  

Facilitates transferring money from the user’s account to another account. 

The recipient’s username and the transfer amount are input. 

The sender’s balance is updated accordingly. 

checkBalance(struct account *acc):  

Displays the current balance of the user’s account. 

displayTransactions(struct transaction *trans):  

Placeholder function (not fully implemented) for displaying transaction history. 

Main Function: 

The main function displays a menu with options:  

Create an account 

Log in 

Exit 

Depending on the user’s choice, it calls the appropriate function. 

Note: 

Some features (like transaction history display) are not fully implemented and are marked as “not implemented.” 

In a real-world application, you’d need to handle more edge cases, error handling, and data persistence (e.g., using files or databases).
